# Azure Data Engineering Project

This repository contains a hands-on **Azure Data Engineering Project** that shows how to build a complete data pipeline using Microsoft Azure services.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

This project demonstrates how to:
✔️ Ingest raw data into Azure Storage  
✔️ Transform and process data using Databricks  
✔️ Load structured data into Azure Synapse for analysis  
✔️ Build an end-to-end scalable Azure data pipeline  

It showcases real data engineering concepts like ETL (Extract-Transform-Load), data storage, and analytics using the Azure ecosystem.

## ⚙️ Tools & Technologies

This project uses these Azure services:

- **Azure Data Factory** – for pipeline orchestration  
- **Azure Storage (ADLS Gen2)** – for data storage  
- **Azure Databricks** – for data transformation  
- **Azure Synapse Analytics** – for data warehousing and querying  

These tools form a typical Azure Data Engineering workflow used in real-world cloud pipelines. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}
